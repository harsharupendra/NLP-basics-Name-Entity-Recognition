# NLP-basics-Name-Entity-Recognition

In this assignment, we will perform the following broad steps:

1. we will process and modify the data into sentence format. This step has to be done for the 'train_sent' and ‘train_label’ datasets and for test datasets as well.
2. After that, we will define the features to build the CRF model.
3. Then, we will apply these features in each sentence of the train and the test dataset to get the feature values.
4. Once the features are computed, we will define the target variable and then build the CRF model.
5. Then, we will perform the evaluation using a test data set.
6. After that, we will create a dictionary in which diseases are keys and treatments are values.
